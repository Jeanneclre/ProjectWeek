# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Artificial Intelligences offer a wide range of applications. There is more and more research about its uses in the medical field and especially on patient images. The question of trustworthiness is on every mind, every time a prediction is given. For that reason, we propose to develop **interpretable deep learning models** for the automated classification of impacted maxillary canines and assessment of root resorption in adjacent teeth using Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). 
Deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were developed and evaluated for classifying impacted maxillary canine position and detecting root resorption. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to generate visual explanations of the CNN predictions, enhancing interpretability and trustworthiness for clinical adoption.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


We are using MONAI frameworks in this project.

1. Data Preparation and Pre-processing
2. Integrate the developed AI algorithms with clinical workflows.
3. Enhancing Explainability and Interpretability in Medical Imaging by deploying a module in 3D Slicer



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Data Preparation and Pre-processing

2. Model Development and Training: Explore and select appropriate neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet, SENets) for image classification and feature visualization.

3. Explainability and Visualization Techniques: Implement methods to make AI decisions transparent and understandable such as Grad-CAM.

4. Validation and Testing

5. Documentation and Training: Create comprehensive documentation and user guides explaining the functionality and benefits of the AI tools.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Trained models with DenseNet architecture to classify the bucolingual position of the impacted maxillary canine and to classify the root resorption.
2. Implementation of GRAD-CAM with MONAI for visualization


Next Steps:
1. Find the best hyper-parameters for the given application to improve the results
2. Deploy a module or an extension in 3D Slicer
