# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Volume Analysis, eXplainability and Interpretability, Volume-AXI, is an explainability approach for classification of bone and teeth structural defects in CBCT scans gray-level images. We propose to develop interpretable AI algorithms to visualize diagnostic features in dental and craniofacial conditions. This work is built on neural network models in Python, specifically using the MONAI framework,

The first clinical application of Volume-AXI is related to dentistry, aiming to identify the position of tooth impaction and damage to adjacent structures. 

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. To create AI algorithms capable of visualizing diagnostic features in dental and craniofacial conditions using CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scan gray-level images.
2. To apply Volume-AXI in the field of dentistry, particularly in identifying the position of impacted teeth and evaluating potential damage to adjacent structures.
3. To address the challenge of explainability in AI-driven image analysis, making the decision-making process of AI more transparent and understandable for clinicians.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Pre-process of the CBCT to get the most of the data we need.

2.  Try different model training with PyTorch.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Actually trying different preprocessing of the CBCT on neural network.
